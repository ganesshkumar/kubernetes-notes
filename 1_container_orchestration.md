# Container Orchestration

**Container** isolated executable environment created from bundled application, dependencies and runtime that can run on any platform like desktops, VMs, Cloud etc.

**Container Orchestrators** are tools which creates cluster from group of hosts to make the applications
* fault-tolerant
* scalable on demand
* consume resources optimally
* discover and communicate with other applications
* accessible to external world
* update/rollback without downtime

Example Container Orchestrators
* Docker Swarm
* Kubernetes
* Mesos Marathon
* Amazon ECS
* Hashicorp Nomad

**Container Orchestrators** can
* make a cluster by bringing multiple hosts together
* schedule containers to run on different hosts
* help containers running on different hosts to communicate with each other
* bind containers with storage
* bind containers of same type into services
* keep resource usage in-check and optimize it when necessary
* allow secure access to applications running inside containers

Container Orchestrators can be deployed anywhere like bare metal, desktops, laptops, VMs, cloud etc.
